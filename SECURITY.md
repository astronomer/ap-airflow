# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Identified vulnerabilities should be reported to <a href="mailto:security@astronomer.io">security@astronomer.io</a>.**

When reporting a vulnerability, we request that you do not publicly disclose any information
regarding the vulnerability until we've had the opportunity to analyze the vulnerability, to
respond to the notification, and to notify key customers and partners, as appropriate.

While we greatly appreciate community reports regarding security issues, Astronomer does not provide
compensation for vulnerability reports at this time.

## Supported Versions

Details on which versions are still in maintenance can be found in the [AC Support Policy](https://docs.astronomer.io/software/ac-support-policy#astronomer-certified-lifecycle-schedule) documentation.
