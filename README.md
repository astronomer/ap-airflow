## Docker images

Docker images for deploying and running Astronomer Core are currently available on
[Quay](https://quay.io/repository/astronomer/ap-airflow?tab=tags).

We publish 2 variants for each AC Version (example: `1.10.15-3`):

**For AC<2.2.0**:
1. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:1.10.15-3-buster`
2. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:1.10.15-3-buster-onbuild`

**For AC>=2.2.0**:

We dropped the distribution name from the image tag so the 2 variants are as follows:

1. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:2.2.1-1`
2. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:2.2.1-1-onbuild`

The only difference between them is that the `-onbuild` images uses Docker `ONBUILD` commands to
copy `packages.txt`, `requirements.txt` and the entire project directory (including `dags`,
`plugins` folders etc) in the docker file.

For each of our `-onbuild` images we publish two flavors of tag:

**For AC<2.2.0**:
1. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:1.10.15-buster-onbuild` which is our latest release of the `1.10.15` series,
including latest security patches. This tag is "floating" or movable.
2. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:1.10.15-3-buster-onbuild` once this tag is pushed it will never change again.

**For AC>=2.2.0**:

1. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:2.2.0-onbuild` which is our latest release of the `2.2.0` series,
including latest security patches. This tag is "floating" or movable.
2. `quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:2.2.0-3-onbuild` once this tag is pushed it will never change again.

4. Edit the new `CHANGELOG.md` to show what has changed in this release.

   Example:

5. Add the new directory to the Git staging area.

6. Run the `update-dockerfiles` pre-commit hook (this should fail but it should change the

### Add a new base build image (eg: new Debian stable release)

<summary>Click to expand Step-By-Step instructions</summary>

1. Add or adjust the Debian release name in `IMAGE_MAP`.

   Example:
   Previous Astronomer Certified versions only built with Debian Buster, but Debian Bullseye has
   just been released as the new Debian stable version and we'd like to add support for that.
   ```diff
   diff --git a/.circleci/common.py b/.circleci/common.py
   index xxxxxxx..yyyyyyy 100644

   +    ("2.3.0-1-dev", ["bullseye", "buster"]),
    ])

    # Airflow Versions for which we don't publish Python Wheels
   ```
2. Add a new version directory for it.

   Example:
   There is currently a `2.3.0/buster` directory that we need to copy to `2.3.0/bullseye` and
   then modify that `Dockerfile` to use Debian Bullseye.
   ```bash
   cp -a 2.3.0/buster 2.3.0/bullseye
   ```
3. Adjust the relevant Dockerfile.

   Example:
   Update the `2.3.0/bullseye/Dockerfile` to use the upstream Debian Bullseye image.
   ```diff
   diff --git a/2.3.0/bullseye/Dockerfile b/2.3.0/bullseye/Dockerfile

4. Stage the changes to the Dockerfile and commit (the pre-commit hooks should all succeed).

<!-- CHANGELOG END -->

## Testing

### Local testing

This testing will run automatically in CI, but it will save some time to try it out locally first.

Airflow is launched into a local Kubernetes cluster using the project "kind" and the most recent
version of the Astronomer airflow chart. Python's 'testinfra' module is used to perform system
testing on the components while they are running in "kind".

### Ensure prerequisites are met:

- docker
- python3
- virtualenv

Ensure docker installed, and user has permissions
```
docker run -it --rm hello-world
```

Ensure Python3 is installed and in PATH
```
python3 -c "print('Confirmed python3 installed.')"
```

Ensure virtualenv is installed
```
which virtualenv
```

### Set up virtual environment

```
virtualenv --python=python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r .circleci/test-requirements.txt
```

### Run system testing

Build the image you want to test
```
docker build -t airflow ./1.10.5/buster
```

Run system testing
```
.circleci/bin/test-airflow airflow
```

The first time you do the build, and the first time you do the system test it will take longer
than subsequent runs. The system testing will install the tested versions of CI tools in /tmp/bin
(helm, kubectl, kind). It will leave an airflow cluster running on your kind cluster in
'test-cluster'. When you run it again, it will delete the namespace of your most recent deployment
and redeploy into a new namespace. If you make changes in the image, don't forget to re-build the
image before testing it.

Use the newly installed tools
```
export PATH=/tmp/bin:$PATH
```

Ensure kubectl configured to use kind
```
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-test-cluster
```

Look at the pods
```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

Clean up
```
kind delete cluster --name test-cluster
```

## Scheduled Tasks

The regularly scheduled tasks are:

#### Edge Builds

* Rebase the `astro-main` branch of [`astronomer/airflow`](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow)
  onto `main` and push it to `astronomer/airflow:astro-main` (this then kicks off a GitHub Actions
  workflow that builds Airflow and Astronomer Certified Python packages/wheels) and pushes them to
  our PyPI package repository
* Build nightly Docker images for QA (using those nightly Airflow and Astronomer Certified wheels)
  and push them to the dev image repository

### CircleCI Schedules

The [CircleCI documentation](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/blob/master/docs/scheduled-pipelines.md)
on scheduled pipelines is very new and in slight disarray.

See also:
* The [announcement](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/scheduled-pipelines-are-here/41684/2) for
  scheduled pipelines
* This [relevant (for now) PR](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/pull/104),
  which includes an example of branch filtering
* Documentation on [parameter syntax](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#parameter-syntax)
* Documentation on [logic statements](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#logic-statements)

The API for manipulating schedules is documented [here](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#tag/Schedule),
including examples.

Here is an example listing all schedules with HTTPie (and colorizing the response with `jq`):

```bash
$ http https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/astronomer/ap-airflow/schedule \
       circle-token:<CIRCLECI_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
       | jq
```

To create a new schedule (refer to the [HTTPie docs about raw JSON](https://httpie.io/docs#json)):

```bash
$ http --verbose \
       https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/astronomer/ap-airflow/schedule \
       circle-token:<CIRCLECI_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
       name="every-morning-0200-UTC" \
       description="Every morning at 02:00 UTC" \
       attribution-actor="system" \
       parameters:='{ "branch": "master" }' \
       timetable:='{ "per-hour": 1, "hours-of-day": [2], "days-of-week": ["SUN", "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI", "SAT"]}'
```

Note that updating and deleting schedules uses a different URL path:

```bash
$ http PATCH \
       https://circleci.com/api/v2/schedule/<schedule_uuid> \
       circle-token:<CRCLECI_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
       name=every-sunday-0100-utc \
       description="Every Sunday at 01:00 UTC"
````

You can create a CircleCI personal API token [in your CircleCI user settings](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens).
Do note that a PAT will authenticate as you, and have full, read and write access on CircleCI, so
keep your PAT secret and do not publish it anywhere!
